from album: [A Girl from the islands](/montay/ep_a_girl_from_the_islands/)



```
Standing by the absurd river
flowing downhill for the fools 
days go by and fade wherever
And no one can change the rules

Together we hide 
a burning lump of coal
It does not shed much light 
but it warms our soul
Nothing else matters
When I look at you, beautiful 
And the promise in your eyes

Let me escape with you
To the horizon of dreams
We’ll find something new 
If we spread our wings 

we’ll laugh at death eyes in the eyes
we’ll cry at life hands in the hands
we’ll share the wine of loving memories 

All around is washed-out despair 
A second-rate reality
Dust is floating bored in the air
Doomed for eternity

Together we hide 
A burning lump of coal
It does not shed much light 
But it warms our soul
Nothing else matters
When I look at you, beautiful 
And the promise in your eyes

Let me escape with you
To the horizon of dreams
We’ll find something new 
If we spread our wings
