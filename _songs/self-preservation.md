from album: [A Girl from the islands](/montay/ep_a_girl_from_the_islands/)



```
My world is a friend
So close and familiar
That I could think
It was born with me

My world 's filled with men
Whose behavior seems so natural
Cause it's the one 
I have always seen

My world yet was built
By million men brains and hearts
And blood
My world is fragile 
And we can come back again
As history can tell
Barbarians

Where would I run?
Where would I hide?
Who would I kill to save my folks?
When my world 
Has come back to wild.
Wild!

My world is a friend

By million men brains and hearts
And blood
My world is fragile 
And we can come back again

Where would I run?
Where would I hide?
Who would I kill to save my folks?
When my world 
Has come back to wild.
Wild!
