```
It's easy to be mean or intolerant
Always have someone to blame is convenient
It's easy to fall in love and to have friends
Easy to find someone to hate or even kill

It's not easy to love
People we don't know
But it's the only way
For us to live in peace
We say it's a foolish dream
When we don't want to try

What if God was a sparse consciousness
That universal love is the safe way to go
And as it's opposite to our natural instinct
We believe this thought is coming from above

It's not easy to love
People we don't know
But it's the only way
For us to live in peace
Think of them as ourselves
Don't we want to be loved?

It's not easy to love
People we don't know
But it's the only way
For us to live in peace
We say it's a foolish dream
But we don't want to try
