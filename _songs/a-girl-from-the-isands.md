from album: [A Girl from the islands](/montay/ep_a_girl_from_the_islands/)



```
Nobody notices me
Except when I’m out with my python
I enjoy people looking at me
But they’re afraid and they call the police

And I’m gonna get married
With this girl from the islands
She knows that I exist
She smiles to me in  the lift 

I live in a demographic city
I try to be one among millions
I feel so dangerously close to zero
That I wish I could be just two

When the world is missing outside,
There’s still my python by my side
It coils up around my heat with no harm
Hugs my body with its long arm

And I’m gonna get married
With this girl from the islands
She knows that I exist
She smiles to me in  the lift 

Each morning at the office, I wait
For her to get into the same lift
She’s wearing boots and a mini-skirt
And each floor is a stop on our lovers’ trip

But I’m gonna get married
With a girl from the islands
She knows that I exist
She smiles to me in  the lift 

And I do my best silence
While we’re travelling in the lift
Yes I do my best silence
While we’re travelling in the lift


```
